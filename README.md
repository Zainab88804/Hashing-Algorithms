## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains **Digital Forensics Lab 1**, where I explored various **hashing algorithms** using **HashCalculator**. The lab focused on testing different hash functions and verifying file integrity.  

## 🔍 Key Tasks  
✔️ Tested **MD5, SHA512, CRC32, and MD4** on empty and filled files.  
✔️ Used **HMAC with password** on different file formats.  
✔️ Verified the integrity of a **LinuxConsole ISO file** by comparing its **MD5SUM value** from the official website.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **HashCalculator** for generating hash values.  
- **LinuxConsole ISO** for integrity verification.
